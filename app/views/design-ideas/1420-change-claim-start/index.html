      Change claim start date
    </h1>
    <p>An effort to allow people to change their claim start date at the end of their application without losing all of the information from their application.
    
    <p>What we don't know is why when a customer changes the claim date the data is not persisted on some parts of the application.

    <p>Worked on by: Neil Holroyd, Gareth Joyce, Mark Bateman</p>
